The beginning of the heart monitor clip ends with the mointor flatlining. I cut this part of the clip and am saving it for the end to signify the shortness/circle of life. 

The baby crying is the first clip following this because it showcases the birth of life - how new it is. There is then empty sound, with only the background music playing, signifying a gap or forward in time. The next clip is a toddler talking.

I like the background music because I think it's light, and ties the beauty of life together.
