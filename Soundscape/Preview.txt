The beginning of the heart monitor clip ends with the mointor flatlining. I cut this part of the clip and am saving it for the end to signify the shortness/circle of life. 

The baby crying is the first clip following this because it showcases the birth of life - how new it is. There is then empty sound, with only the background music playing, signifying a gap or forward in time. The next clip is a toddler talking.

I like the background music because I think it's light, and ties the beauty of life together.

I'm almost done with my project! I need to source and record a couple more clips to finish it up, but will definitely have it done by the time the project is due. It's actually getting more difficult because I have so many audio tracks on Audacity, my computer is becoming slower and less responsive. I might have to approve what I have, turn it into one rendered file and then continue to work on it so that it is not as slow. 

I feel like I jumped between major milestones of this fictional character in the soundscape pretty quickly. It's also not super reflective of one's life -- but how much audio can I include to keep this 3-4 minutes? So many sounds happen in a lifetime, let alone in a day. 

Right now, my character just got accepted into college. I'm having trouble thinking of what audio should come next. Should I do some classroom audio from her experience in college, and then jump to her graduation? Then her work, marriage, children, grandchildren, and ultimately death? I need to sit down and figure all of this out before the deadline. Hoping that it will all come together soon!
