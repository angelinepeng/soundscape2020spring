For my Soundscape, I really wanted to capture the beauty of life -- how we continuously move in circles from one generation to the next, how short, but sweet and simple life is. 

The beginning of my sounscape starts with hospital beeps and a baby crying signifying the beginning of the protagonist's life. As listeners, we continue to hear her grow and grow, until eventually she becomes a mother herself. The last soundclips of the Soundscape are the same as the beginning. 

This is a fictional work, but I believe it is generally reflective of the life we live. Not all people will experience life the same way or even in the same order as the character in my narrative, but these are all reflections of life that we are familiar with whether it be within our own lives or others around us. 

I hope you enjoy.
